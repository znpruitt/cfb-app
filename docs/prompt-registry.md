## Active Prompts

### P4D-NOCLAIM-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Fix selectOwnerCareer NoClaim early return — remove it so archived season data is preserved; add explicit NoClaim guard in H2H opponent aggregation loop.
- Scope: `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts` only.
- Notes: PR #207. selectOwnerCareer now returns real data for NoClaim; NoClaim excluded from H2H matrix only. All other NoClaim exclusions unchanged.

### P4D-HISTORY-BANNER-v1
- Purpose: Add "Season in Progress" card to ChampionshipsBanner showing current season leader when active season is not yet archived.
- Scope: `src/components/history/ChampionshipsBanner.tsx` (new props + card), `src/app/league/[slug]/history/page.tsx` (pass props).
- Notes: PR #207. Neutral gray/white border distinct from amber champion card. "Current Leader" label. Derives first non-NoClaim owner from liveStandings. No card when props absent.

### P4D-HISTORY-LAYOUT-v1
- Purpose: Redesign history landing page to asymmetric 60/40 split using lg:grid-cols-5 with col-span-3/col-span-2.
- Scope: `src/app/league/[slug]/history/page.tsx` only.
- Notes: PR #207. ChampionshipsBanner remains full width above grid. Single column on mobile unchanged.

### P4D-HISTORY-POLISH-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Read-only review of P4D-HISTORY-POLISH-v1 implementation against specification.
- Scope: Read-only. All files modified by P4D-HISTORY-POLISH-v1.
- Notes: All items passed. One partial finding: ChampionshipsBanner renders full-width above grid rather than in left column per spec — accepted as better UX. Overall recommendation: Merge.

### P4D-HISTORY-POLISH-v1
- Purpose: Fix all-time standings sort order, remove NoClaim from all history views, redesign history landing to two-column layout, add League History nav tab, merge live season data into all-time standings.
- Scope: `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts`, `src/components/history/AllTimeStandingsTable.tsx`, `src/app/league/[slug]/history/page.tsx`, `src/components/WeekViewTabs.tsx`, `src/components/CFBScheduleApp.tsx`.
- Notes: PR #207. winPct added to AllTimeStandingRow; sort: championships → winPct → totalWins. NoClaim excluded from 4 selectors. liveStandings optional param added to selectAllTimeStandings. History Link tab in WeekViewTabs via leagueSlug prop.

### P4-HISTORICAL-SCORES-CACHE-v1
- Purpose: Add POST /api/admin/cache-historical-scores — admin-gated, fetches and caches CFBD scores for a specified past year into the exact keys buildSeasonArchive reads.
- Scope: `src/app/api/admin/cache-historical-scores/route.ts` (new).
- Notes: PR #207. Writes scope=`scores`, keys=`${year}-all-regular` and `${year}-all-postseason`. alreadyCached when both keys exist. force: true to overwrite. Rejects active season year.

### P4-HISTORICAL-SCHEDULE-CACHE-v1
- Purpose: Add POST /api/admin/cache-historical-schedule — admin-gated, fetches and caches CFBD schedule for a specified past year into the exact key buildSeasonArchive reads.
- Scope: `src/app/api/admin/cache-historical-schedule/route.ts` (new).
- Notes: PR #207. Writes scope=`schedule`, key=`${year}-all-all`. alreadyCached check prevents quota waste. force: true to overwrite. Rejects active season year.

### P4D-CLOSEOUT-v1
- Purpose: Close out Phase 4D and Historical Season Backfill in planning docs; register all P4D and backfill prompt IDs; set Phase 5 as next planned campaign.
- Scope: docs only — completed-work.md, roadmap.md, next-tasks.md, prompt-registry.md. No code changes.
- Notes: Phase 4 fully complete. Phase 5 set as active focus.

### P4D-BUGS-v1
- Purpose: Fix two post-merge bugs: double-decoding URIError crash on owner route param, and rivalry lead/trail/tied label always showing ownerA regardless of record.
- Scope: `src/app/league/[slug]/history/owner/[name]/page.tsx` (remove double-decode), `src/components/history/AllTimeHeadToHeadPanel.tsx` (three-way leader label).
- Notes: Double-decode: Next.js App Router already decodes params — `decodeURIComponent` must not be applied again. Label fix: three-way conditional (ownerA leads / ownerB leads / series tied).

### P4D-BACKFILL-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Read-only review of P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-FIX-v1 and P4-BACKFILL-v1 implementations against their specifications.
- Scope: Read-only. All P4D UI fix files and backfill endpoint.
- Notes: Found critical bug: `slug` declared in Props but not destructured in `AllTimeHeadToHeadPanel` — produced `/league/undefined/...` URLs. Addressed by P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-FIX-v2.

### P4-BACKFILL-v1
- Purpose: Create `POST /api/admin/backfill` endpoint — admin-gated, builds and saves `SeasonArchive` for a specified past year, never calls `updateLeague`, two-phase confirmation when existing archive would be overwritten.
- Scope: `src/app/api/admin/backfill/route.ts` (new).
- Notes: Intentionally does NOT call `updateLeague` or advance the active season year. Two-phase: first call returns `requiresConfirmation: true` with diff; second call with `confirmed: true` performs overwrite.

### P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-FIX-v2
- Purpose: Fix critical bug — `slug` was declared in `AllTimeHeadToHeadPanel` Props but omitted from component destructuring, producing `/league/undefined/history/owner/.../` URLs.
- Scope: `src/components/history/AllTimeHeadToHeadPanel.tsx` only — destructuring fix.
- Notes: PR #204. One-line fix caught in P4D-BACKFILL-REVIEW-v1.

### P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Fix 5 review findings: missing career page Links in AllTimeHeadToHeadPanel, DynastyDroughtPanel, MostImprovedPanel; missing Games Back column in SeasonFinishHistory; wrong empty state copy on landing page.
- Scope: `src/components/history/AllTimeHeadToHeadPanel.tsx`, `src/components/history/DynastyDroughtPanel.tsx`, `src/components/history/MostImprovedPanel.tsx`, `src/components/history/SeasonFinishHistory.tsx`, `src/app/league/[slug]/history/page.tsx`.
- Notes: PR #204.

### P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Read-only review of P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-v1 implementation against detailed checklist.
- Scope: Read-only. All files created or modified by P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-v1.
- Notes: Found 5 items requiring fixes — addressed by P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-FIX-v1.

### P4D-LEAGUE-HISTORY-UI-v1
- Purpose: Implement League History landing page, Owner Career page, seven cross-season selectors, and back link update in history/[year]/page.tsx.
- Scope: `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts` (7 new selectors + OwnerSeasonRecord.gamesBack), `src/app/league/[slug]/history/page.tsx` (new), `src/app/league/[slug]/history/owner/[name]/page.tsx` (new), `src/app/league/[slug]/history/[year]/page.tsx` (back link update), `src/components/history/` (9 new components).
- Notes: PR #204. Nine new history components: ChampionshipsBanner, AllTimeStandingsTable, SeasonListPanel, MostImprovedPanel, DynastyDroughtPanel, AllTimeHeadToHeadPanel, CareerSummaryCard, SeasonFinishHistory, AllTimeOwnerHeadToHeadPanel.

### P4D-KICKOFF-v1
- Purpose: Close out roster upload fuzzy matching in planning docs, register all prompt IDs, and set P4D as the active phase.
- Scope: docs only — completed-work.md, roadmap.md, next-tasks.md, prompt-registry.md. No code changes.
- Notes: Fuzzy matching complete. P4D kickoff.

### P4-ROSTER-UPLOAD-FUZZY-MATCH-FIX-v2
- Purpose: Fix two bugs from review: exhaustive alias migration across all league years via listAppStateKeys(), and persistent upload error display for auto-upload failures.
- Scope: `src/lib/server/globalAliasStore.ts` (migration year range + listAppStateKeys), `src/components/RosterUploadPanel.tsx` (phase-agnostic uploadError with retry button).
- Notes: PR #203.

### P4-ROSTER-UPLOAD-FUZZY-MATCH-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Wire lazy migrateYearScopedAliasesToGlobal() call in GET /api/aliases?scope=global so migration runs automatically on first global alias read after deploy.
- Scope: `src/app/api/aliases/route.ts` only — added getLeagues() call and migration invocation in the global scope GET branch.
- Notes: PR #203.

### P4-ROSTER-UPLOAD-FUZZY-MATCH-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Read-only review of P4-ROSTER-UPLOAD-FUZZY-MATCH-v1 implementation against the prompt specification.
- Scope: Read-only. All files introduced or modified in the fuzzy matching implementation.
- Notes: One failure found: migrateYearScopedAliasesToGlobal() was unreachable (no call site). Addressed by FIX-v1. All other 38 items passed. Recommendation: fix before merge.

### P4-ROSTER-UPLOAD-FUZZY-MATCH-v1
- Purpose: Add FBS-only fuzzy matching validation to the owner roster CSV upload pipeline.
- Scope: `src/lib/rosterUploadValidator.ts` (new), `src/lib/server/globalAliasStore.ts` (new), `src/app/api/owners/validate/route.ts` (new), `src/components/RosterUploadPanel.tsx` (new), `src/app/api/owners/route.ts` (PUT guard), `src/app/api/aliases/route.ts` (?scope=global), `src/app/admin/page.tsx` (RosterUploadPanel).
- Notes: PR #203.

### P4-ROSTER-UPLOAD-FUZZY-MATCH-DOCS-v1
- Purpose: Document the roster upload fuzzy matching design in planning docs and AGENTS.md before implementation.
- Scope: `docs/phase-4-historical-analytics-design.md` (§9 Roster Upload Validation), `AGENTS.md` (rule #10 upload-layer-only constraint). Docs only.
- Notes: PR #202.

### P4C-CLOSEOUT-v1
- Purpose: Update completed-work.md, roadmap.md, next-tasks.md, and prompt-registry.md to reflect P4C complete; register all P4C prompt IDs; set Roster Upload Fuzzy Matching as active next focus.
- Scope: docs only — no code changes.
- Notes: PR #201 closeout. Phase 4C complete.

### P4C-BUGS-v1
- Purpose: Fix three post-implementation bugs: exclude same-owner matchups from getOwnedFinalGames; fix back links pointing to unbuilt P4D route.
- Scope: `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts` (same-owner guard in getOwnedFinalGames), `src/app/league/[slug]/history/[year]/page.tsx` (both back link instances).
- Notes: PR #201. Same-owner guard added to prevent self-blowouts/self-H2H contamination; back links changed to `/league/${slug}/` with TODO comments.

### P4C-LINT-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Investigate and remove unused `ownerB` variable assignment in selectHeadToHead.
- Scope: `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts` only.
- Notes: PR #201. Confirmed not a logic bug — `pairingKey()` independently derives canonical ordering; assignment was dead code.

### P4C-ARCHIVE-DATA-MODEL-FIX-v2
- Purpose: Add `?? []` and `?? {}` null guards at both selector consumption points in historySelectors.ts for backward compatibility with legacy archives.
- Scope: `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts` only — two call sites.
- Notes: PR #201. Prevents `TypeError: undefined is not iterable` when rendering archives written before games/scoresByKey fields were added.

### P4C-ARCHIVE-DATA-MODEL-FIX-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Read-only review of P4C-ARCHIVE-DATA-MODEL-FIX-v1 implementation — verify correctness and identify gaps.
- Scope: Read-only. `src/lib/seasonArchive.ts`, `src/lib/seasonRollover.ts`, `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts`.
- Notes: Identified one critical gap — old archives with undefined games/scoresByKey would throw TypeError at runtime. Addressed by P4C-ARCHIVE-DATA-MODEL-FIX-v2.

### P4C-ARCHIVE-DATA-MODEL-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Add `games: AppGame[]` and `scoresByKey: Record<string, ScorePack>` to `SeasonArchive`; update `buildSeasonArchive` to populate both fields; rewrite superlative and H2H selectors to derive from game data.
- Scope: `src/lib/seasonArchive.ts`, `src/lib/seasonRollover.ts`, `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts`.
- Notes: PR #201. Required because `StandingsHistory` stores cumulative per-owner stats only — no individual game pairings available from that model.

### P4C-SEASON-DETAIL-UI-v1
- Purpose: Implement `/league/[slug]/history/[year]/` season detail page with selectors, 6 history components, and server component page.
- Scope: `src/lib/selectors/historySelectors.ts` (new), `src/app/league/[slug]/history/[year]/page.tsx` (new), `src/components/history/` (6 new components: ArchiveBanner, FinalStandingsTable, SeasonArcChart, SuperlativesPanel, HeadToHeadPanel, OwnerRosterCard).
- Notes: PR #201. Initial implementation discovered StandingsHistory gap — follow-on P4C-ARCHIVE-DATA-MODEL-FIX-v1 added games/scoresByKey to SeasonArchive.

### P3-MULTILEG-CLOSEOUT-v1
- Purpose: Audit Phase 3 implementation against design doc, update planning docs to reflect Phase 3 complete, register all Phase 3 prompt IDs.
- Scope: docs only — completed-work.md, roadmap.md, next-tasks.md, prompt-registry.md, phase-3-multi-league-design.md.
- Notes: Phase 3 closeout. No code changes.

### P3-MULTILEG-FALLBACK-CLEANUP-v1
- Purpose: Remove now-redundant `readAliasesScopedOnly` function from aliases route — identical to `readAliases` after fallback removal.
- Scope: `src/app/api/aliases/route.ts` only.
- Notes: PR #196. Follow-on to P3-MULTILEG-FALLBACK-REMOVAL-v1.

### P3-MULTILEG-FALLBACK-REMOVAL-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Read-only verification that fallback removal is correct and scope helpers preserve the no-league-param path.
- Scope: Read-only. `src/app/api/owners/route.ts`, `src/app/api/aliases/route.ts`, `src/app/api/postseason-overrides/route.ts`.
- Notes: All items passed. Flagged that `readAliasesScopedOnly` was now redundant — addressed by P3-MULTILEG-FALLBACK-CLEANUP-v1.

### P3-MULTILEG-FALLBACK-REMOVAL-v1
- Purpose: Remove temporary TRANSITION FALLBACK from all three durable data GET handlers after TSC migration confirmed complete.
- Scope: `src/app/api/owners/route.ts`, `src/app/api/aliases/route.ts`, `src/app/api/postseason-overrides/route.ts` — GET handlers only.
- Notes: PR #196. No-league-param path unchanged on all three routes.

### P3-MULTILEG-ADMIN-UI-COPY-v1
- Purpose: Replace developer terminology with plain-language commissioner-facing copy on `/admin/leagues/`.
- Scope: `src/app/admin/leagues/page.tsx` only — copy and labels only.
- Notes: PR #195. Slug field relabeled "League URL", annotation updated to "(URL — permanent)", header description rewritten, empty state example year corrected to 2025.

### P3-MULTILEG-ADMIN-UI-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Improve empty state seed reminder to include example values for slug, display name, and year.
- Scope: `src/app/admin/leagues/page.tsx` only.
- Notes: PR #194. Empty state now includes: league URL — work-league, display name — Work League, year — 2025.

### P3-MULTILEG-ADMIN-UI-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Pre-merge review of P3-MULTILEG-ADMIN-UI-v1 implementation.
- Scope: Read-only. `src/app/admin/leagues/page.tsx`, `src/components/AdminDebugSurface.tsx`.
- Notes: One partial finding — empty state seed reminder lacked example values. Addressed by P3-MULTILEG-ADMIN-UI-FIX-v1.

### P3-MULTILEG-ADMIN-UI-v1
- Purpose: Create `/admin/leagues/` management page for commissioner to view, create, and edit leagues.
- Scope: `src/app/admin/leagues/page.tsx` (new), `src/components/AdminDebugSurface.tsx` (League Management link).
- Notes: PR #194. Reuses `AdminAuthPanel`, `requireAdminAuthHeaders`. Inline edit, create form with client-side slug validation.

### P3-MULTILEG-WRITE-SCOPE-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Read-only verification that write-scope fix correctly passes `leagueSlug` through all save functions.
- Scope: Read-only. API client functions and CFBScheduleApp save call sites.
- Notes: All items passed. Recommend merge.

### P3-MULTILEG-WRITE-SCOPE-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Fix write-path bug — save functions were not passing `leagueSlug` to API calls despite reads being league-scoped.
- Scope: `src/lib/aliasesApi.ts`, `src/lib/ownersApi.ts`, `src/lib/postseasonOverridesApi.ts`, `src/components/CFBScheduleApp.tsx`.
- Notes: PR #193. Establishes full read/write symmetry for all three durable data paths.

### P3-MULTILEG-ROUTING-FIX-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Read-only verification of routing fix — bootstrap chain threading and matchup href.

- Notes: All items passed. Recommend merge.

### P3-MULTILEG-ROUTING-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Thread `leagueSlug` through full bootstrap chain; restore `?view=matchups` on matchup insight links.
- Scope: `src/lib/bootstrap.ts`, `src/components/hooks/useScheduleBootstrap.ts`, `src/components/OverviewPanel.tsx`.
- Notes: PR #193. Bootstrap chain now complete: CFBScheduleApp → useScheduleBootstrap → bootstrapAliasesAndCaches → all three load functions.

### P3-MULTILEG-ROUTING-REVIEW-v1
- Purpose: Pre-merge review of P3-MULTILEG-ROUTING-v1 routing implementation.
- Scope: Read-only. All new league route files, root redirects, navigation components.
- Notes: Two findings: bootstrap chain not threaded end-to-end; matchup insight href missing `?view=matchups`. Both addressed by P3-MULTILEG-ROUTING-FIX-v1.

### P3-MULTILEG-ROUTING-v1
- Purpose: Implement `/league/[slug]/` route hierarchy; convert root routes to registry-based redirects; update navigation components.
- Scope: `src/app/league/[slug]/` (new pages), `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/standings/page.tsx`, `src/app/rankings/page.tsx`, `src/app/trends/page.tsx`, `src/components/CFBScheduleApp.tsx`, `src/components/OverviewPanel.tsx`, `src/components/RankingsPageContent.tsx`.
- Notes: PR #193. Root routes read registry at request time; redirect to first league's slug or render empty state if no leagues.

### P3-MULTILEG-FOUNDATION-FIX-v2
- Purpose: Fix malformed slug silent coercion bug and alias incremental merge inheritance bug.
- Scope: `src/app/api/aliases/route.ts` (readAliasesScopedOnly), `src/app/api/owners/route.ts`, `src/app/api/postseason-overrides/route.ts`.
- Notes: PR #192. Added slug format validation to PUT routes. Introduced `readAliasesScopedOnly` to prevent new leagues inheriting legacy alias map on first incremental write.

### P3-MULTILEG-FOUNDATION-FIX-VERIFY-v1
- Purpose: Read-only verification that registry check is only in PUT (not GET) after FIX-v1 changes.
- Scope: Read-only. `src/app/api/admin/leagues/route.ts` only.
- Notes: Confirmed GET is public, PUT has registry validation. Verified correct.

### P3-MULTILEG-FOUNDATION-FIX-v1
- Purpose: Fix three pre-merge review findings — duplicate guard into `addLeague()`, GET leagues public, PUT registry validation.
- Scope: `src/lib/leagueRegistry.ts`, `src/app/api/admin/leagues/route.ts`, `src/app/api/owners/route.ts`, `src/app/api/aliases/route.ts`, `src/app/api/postseason-overrides/route.ts`.

- Notes: PR #188. Covers the three-commit sequence merged on phase-3b-visual-sweep.

### P2C-STANDINGS-RULE-AND-DOCS-REALIGNMENT-v1
- Purpose: Fix standings sort to wins-first (primary) per league rules; add regression tests; realign docs to match.
