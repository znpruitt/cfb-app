# CFB App Roadmap

## Development philosophy

The CFB app is a single-developer, AI-assisted, league-first web app that should stay predictable, maintainable, and economical to run.

Core principles:

- **Schedule-first game identity.** The schedule remains the canonical source of truth for the game universe.
- **API-first ingestion.** CFBD and The Odds API remain upstream sources of truth for schedule/scores and odds.
- **Shared cached production reads.** Hosted member traffic should primarily consume shared cached state instead of repeatedly triggering upstream rebuild work.
- **Small durable footprint.** Use one small managed database for truly persistent shared state.
- **Quota-conscious freshness.** Freshness matters, but it must be balanced against CFBD and Odds API monthly quotas.
- **Admin-controlled persistence and refresh.** Season-persistent shared data should update through commissioner/admin flows, not opportunistically from public traffic.
- **Diagnostics over silent failure.** Problems should surface clearly and be recoverable.
- **Prompt traceability.** Codex prompts should use standardized headers and stable `PROMPT_ID`s so work can be referenced and revised cleanly across phases.

Prompt format and registry guidance live in `docs/prompt-registry.md`.

## Current status

- Phase 1 architecture stabilization is complete.
- Core league surfaces are in place.
- Phase 2A production hardening is **complete**:
  - admin-only rebuild semantics enforced for schedule/reference refresh paths
  - diagnostics distinguish shared authoritative state from ephemeral process-memory counters
  - targeted mobile responsiveness fixes shipped; core member surfaces validated for real-device use
- Phase 2B league UX / engagement is **complete**.
- Phase 2C overview visual redesign is **complete**.
- The active milestone is **Phase 2D overview trends visual sweep** — PR #183 open.

## Production data policy

See `docs/vision.md` for the canonical production data policy.

## Hosted production target

### Goal
Deliver a hosted app that league members can reliably use throughout the season with low commissioner overhead and controlled API usage.

### Recommended stack
- **Vercel** for app hosting, preview deploys, and production deploys.
- **One small managed Postgres** for shared durable state.
- No extra queue/worker/cache layer unless proven necessary.

### Durable shared state target
Keep this intentionally small:
- aliases
- owner roster
- postseason overrides
- team database snapshot
- durable odds snapshots if retained for line continuity
- season/reference snapshots only where they materially reduce repeated upstream rebuild work

## Roadmap phases

## Phase 2A — Production hardening (complete)

### Objective
Make the existing league-first app safe and efficient for hosted member traffic without rewriting the architecture.

### Key workstreams

#### 1. Production hosting readiness
- Validate hosted deployment assumptions for serverless execution.
- Remove dependence on writable local runtime files for shared production state.
- Make shared cache behavior deterministic enough for member traffic.

#### 2. Durable shared storage
- Introduce a small shared durable storage layer for commissioner-managed data.
- Keep file fallback only for local development or non-hosted scenarios if helpful.
- Ensure public/member reads consume the shared version of the data.

#### 3. Shared owner roster
- Persist the owner roster server-side so all members get the same league mapping.
- Preserve commissioner upload/edit workflows, but stop relying on per-browser local storage as the primary source.

#### 4. Shared alias persistence
- Persist alias edits durably and make all server consumers read through the same shared path.
- Preserve diagnostics and alias repair workflows.

#### 5. Admin protection for mutating routes
- Protect commissioner-only actions such as alias edits, owner uploads, forced refreshes, and team sync.
- Keep public/member reads broadly accessible.

#### 6. Persistent season data caching
- Treat schedule/reference data as shared cached state.
- Refresh these data only through admin-triggered rebuild flows.
- Ensure member traffic primarily reads cached/shared season data.

#### 7. Quota-safe scores and odds refresh
- Scores: shared cache-first with conservative freshness windows.
- Odds: especially conservative, favor existing shared snapshots and admin/manual refresh over repeated public upstream fetches.
- Avoid wasteful polling-heavy production behavior.

#### 8. Production observability and recovery tooling
- Clarify which diagnostics are authoritative versus ephemeral.
- Add recovery guidance for quota exhaustion, stale cache, alias mistakes, and owner-roster mistakes.
- Preserve commissioner-facing diagnostics for schedule/score/odds reconciliation.

#### 9. Mobile/device production validation
- Validate the hosted experience on mobile Safari, Android Chrome, and major desktop browsers.
- Confirm commissioner/admin flows remain usable enough on small screens.

### Completion criteria
Phase 2A is complete when:
- core commissioner-managed state is shared and durable
- public traffic primarily reads shared cached state
- mutating/admin flows are protected
- schedule-first architecture remains intact
- quota usage is conservative enough for the hobby-scale deployment target

## Phase 2B — League UX / engagement (complete)

Complete. See `docs/completed-work.md` for the full record.
PROMPT_ID: P2B-OVERVIEW-UX-CAMPAIGN-v1

## Phase 2C — Overview Visual Redesign (complete)

Complete. See `docs/completed-work.md` for the full record.
PROMPT_ID: P2C-OVERVIEW-REDESIGN-v1

## Phase 2D — Overview Trends Visual Sweep (complete / PR #183 open)

See `docs/completed-work.md` for the full record.
PROMPT_IDs: P2D-TRENDS-TITLE-CHASE-v1, P2D-TRENDS-FORM-DOTS-v1

## Phase 3 — Historical analytics (optional)

### Objective
Add historical/analytical features only after hosted current-season operation is stable.

### Examples
- season archives
- upset / odds retrospectives
- historical owner performance summaries
- deeper visualizations

## Phase 4 — Multi-league commissioner support (future)

### Objective
Support multiple private leagues managed by the same commissioner while preserving shared global sports data pipelines.

### Scope

- Multiple private leagues (work/family/friends-style) under one commissioner.
- League-specific data is the ownership overlay (owner roster/mapping and related league views).
- Shared global CFB data remains common across leagues:
  - schedule
  - scores
  - odds
  - rankings
  - conferences
- Likely routing boundary: league slug or `leagueId` scoped league pages.

### Non-goals

- No duplication of CFBD ingestion/schedule pipelines per league.
- No broad SaaS/self-serve multi-tenant platform redesign.
- No change to the small-footprint production model unless scale requirements prove it necessary.

## Architecture rules

See `docs/cfb-engineering-operating-instructions.md` Section 5 for canonical architecture principles.
