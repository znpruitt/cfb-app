/**
 * INSIGHTS-029 — the serving selection, replacing `applySuppression`.
 *
 * **The feed was not thin, it was DRAINED.** Suppression is per insight TYPE and
 * almost every type carried `{ kind: 'unchanged' }` — suppress while the stat
 * value is identical. In preseason no games are played, so no stat value can
 * ever change: each insight fired once and was hidden for the rest of the
 * preseason. A live league's Overview showed exactly two cards, and both were on
 * `NEVER_SUPPRESS_TYPES`; those three types were the only reason anything
 * rendered at all.
 *
 * "Fire once, then fade" only makes sense while something is moving. Out of
 * season nothing is, so the rule degenerated into "show each insight once, ever".
 *
 * Deliberately just a sort and a slice — no store reads, no writes, no
 * per-request state. Repetition across loads is not a problem worth machinery
 * while a league has fewer insights than the feed holds; when INSIGHTS-023
 * widens the pool past the feed, rotation earns its keep and gets built against a
 * real pool (INSIGHTS-018).
 *
 * `suppression.ts` is left in place and simply not consulted here: its records
 * age out under their own TTL and the rollover clear that already exists, so
 * nothing is destructively migrated and the debug endpoint keeps working.
